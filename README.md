# Natan Maia
Hello, I'm Nate, an aspiring game developer from Brazil! Currently an undergraduate at Computer Science at the *Universidade Federal do CearÃ¡*.

I have a background in national Math Olympiads and a decade of drawing as a pasttime.
I enjoy working on UI and UX but am not afraid to implement my own systems and models if needed.
Brainstorming game mechanics and characters with friends has become routine at this point.
